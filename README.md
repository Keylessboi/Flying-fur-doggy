# Important Annoucement
This project is currently under a COMPLETE rewrite! Please check back in a few days before downloading. Signatures for windows to disable smartscreen will most likely not be added as this is meant to be a linux-only application. But windows bugs will be fixed with time.


Known bugs:

1. Windows program lists required librarys do not exist and exits the program. [Will be fixed once rewrite is finished]


I want to eventually make this project have a gui and some other cool things incorporated. For now I'm still learning c++ so this will stay as a terminal application.
